Summary:
So I finished all of the project.I used a lot the the code that I had for the last project.
I used the inorder function to add the sums together.
To compile the project I have a makefile. THe exection should be ./proj7. 
I also have a log file, that prints out the list in order. It is called inorder.txt
I also print out the number of nodes to show the how many there are.
