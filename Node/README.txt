Proj6

Compile:
To compile this project I made a makefile, and the execution should be ./proj6

Notes:
I believe that I have completed this project completely. It works with the 100 values and 100000 values in BTS1.
You can change the number of runs by changing BTS1 in the main. The log file shows the transversal of both trees.
The doxygen pdf is in the latex file.
