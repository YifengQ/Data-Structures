Comments:
I realised that there was two problems to this project, and that it might require different main files to fun them. But i combined the two
problems into 1 main file. I decided not to have a a trace because there is 99999 events, so I just have it print out to the log file 
the average data.

Done:
What I believe I finished was the array based implementation. I could run the program for 1 teller and 1 queue, along with calculation all
the values that are required for the output. I have the log file, which is log.txt and the sorted array is stored in data.txt. I also have
the tables in a excel file and exported it to a pdf file as well. There is a test output in as test.PNG and the doxygen is in the latex file.

Not Done / Partially Done:
I would say that the 1 teller 3 queue, and the linked list implemntaion is not done. I have partial implemntaion for linked list, but didn't have the 
time to test it in the main. I have made the classes for the linked list, but i am not sure if it is correct, so i commented out the include linkedList. I tried to do the 3 teller 1 queue, and I beleive that I an half way there but not completely, so I left that in main
as simulation 2, but didn't include it in log file or out put. 

Compiling:
I have a make file for the program, so just run make, and then the execution should be ./proj5.
