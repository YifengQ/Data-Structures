I have a makefile for every problem. They are sperated into their own folders. Each one has a log that corresponds to it. 
I believe that I did it right. I am not really sure what the correct input is, but i would recommmend using my input files. If you want
to change then, i don't ask for the input files, but they are a char array so you can change them if you want.

I included the screenshots as my test output.

A problem that I had was that I didin't know what problem12 really wanted. So I just stored it in the tryNext as it said.

As each folder has a makefile

it should be 

make

then

../main__

the underscore is for the question number ie. ./main11 

So they all should work properly
