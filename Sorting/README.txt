I believe that I did everything right. To compile, there is a make file and the executable is proj4 after make.
I have 6 log files. Anything with _data is the compile time and swaps, etc. Logs with _sort, is the before and after of the array.
I would say that i got confused on the comparisions and swaps, so i just made variables that made sense to me.
The tables and graphs are in a excel sheet. Just in case I have it saved to a pdf file as well.
I did the 1million for bubble but couldn't for merge and radix.
I also have implemntation for quick sort, but never used it.
